I'm a novice front-end developer with a strong desire to learn and progress as quick as it's possible. 
I have already learned basics of HTML and CSS (please see Courses section), got my hands dirty with SQL (queries, joins, partitions) and I'm looking forward for participation in the Rolling Scopes School.
